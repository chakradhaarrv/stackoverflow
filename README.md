## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. What are some of the most common platforms, miscellaneous tech, programming languages and desired databases being used by developers right now and what do they want to work on in the future?
2. What is the relationship between education level and their earnings in USD, how much should I expect?
3. What collaborator platforms are most common right now, what should I start using?
4. What the most important Job Factors are for certain kinds of developers, what should I be looking for while I look for my job? Could this be more specific based on the kind of roles people have?

## Results<a name="results"></a>
